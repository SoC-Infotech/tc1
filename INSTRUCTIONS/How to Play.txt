How it Works

Hangman is a literacy game that requires you to guess a word by selecting from letters A through Z.
When letters are chosen correctly, the letters will show on screen. When a letter is chosen incorrectly
water fills the jar. If too many letters are incorrect, the jar will fill and drown the player. When winning a smiley shows on screen the telling you congrats.
When you guess too many wrong, the game ends and loss appears on screen.

You have 3 difficulties to select: Easy, Normal or Hard. Words on each difficulty are longer than each other.
Example: Easy - up to 6 Letters, Normal - up to 12 letters or multiple words, Hard - Multiple words and above 12 letters.
Select a letter to receive an outcome based on if it was correct or not.
